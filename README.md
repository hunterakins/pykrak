Python translation of Michael Porter's KRAKEN (not KRAKENC).

> An alternative implementation, which provided an internal wave mode equation solver using the same numerical methods as Richard Evans `FORTRAN` model WAVE, can be found on an archived branch of the code called `rev1_archive`.

The code is provided "as is", with no guarantees of correctness. When in doubt, compare to KRAKEN and KRAKENC.
Comparisons for a number of test environments are provided in `tests/`.
